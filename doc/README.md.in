# data-true

DataTrue is a framework for ensuring a set of related JavaScript objects are always in a valid state where "valid" is defined by a set of functions you specify. Think of it sort of like constrains and trigger in SQL, but for JavaScript objects.

> DataTrue is ready for cautious production use, but has not had extensive real-world testing. See _Current Status_ below for details.
